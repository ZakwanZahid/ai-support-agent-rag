"""Row-level security, against a real Postgres.

The rest of the suite runs on in-memory SQLite, which has no row-level
security and no session variables — it would report these policies as working
without ever evaluating one. So this module talks to Postgres or skips.

Set `RLS_TEST_DATABASE_URL` to run it:

    RLS_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://postgres:postgres@localhost:5433/rls_test

CI sets it against a pgvector service. Locally it is opt-in, so nobody has to
have Postgres up to run the other 80-odd tests.

Two connections, deliberately. The owner builds the schema, creates the
application role and installs the policies; the application role is what the
assertions run as. Testing through the owner would have proved nothing — the
first version of this file did exactly that and passed while the policies were
being bypassed, because Postgres exempts superusers and table owners from
row-level security.
