"""CORS configuration: the deploy blocker this closes.

CORS used to register only when `APP_ENV` looked local, so a deployed
frontend was silently blocked by the browser — the request never reached
FastAPI, so nothing in the server logs explained why. These tests are about
the two things that make that mistake hard to repeat: the middleware now
always registers, and a non-local deployment with no origin configured fails
at startup instead of failing silently in someone's browser.
