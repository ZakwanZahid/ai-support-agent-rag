# Architecture Decisions

## ADR-001: Shared Database, Shared Schema, Organization ID

Status: Accepted

The MVP uses one PostgreSQL database and one shared schema. Tenant-owned tables carry `organization_id` directly. This keeps local operations simple, supports efficient tenant filters, and prepares the system for PostgreSQL Row Level Security. The tradeoff is that tenant scoping must be enforced consistently in application queries until RLS is added.

## ADR-002: PostgreSQL and pgvector for MVP Retrieval

Status: Accepted

Embeddings live beside chunk metadata in PostgreSQL through pgvector rather than in a separate vector database. This reduces infrastructure, preserves transactional relationships, and is sufficient for the expected MVP scale. A dedicated vector system remains an option if scale or retrieval requirements outgrow PostgreSQL.

## ADR-003: SQLAlchemy and Alembic for Schema Control

Status: Accepted

SQLAlchemy 2.0 declarative models define the application schema, and Alembic records the database history. This gives the backend typed relationships, reviewable migrations, repeatable local setup, and a controlled path to production schema changes.

## ADR-004: Citations Stored Separately from Messages

Status: Accepted

`message_citations` is a separate table rather than JSON embedded in a message. Each citation can point to the source document and exact chunk, preserving traceability, supporting audits and feedback analysis, and allowing retrieval metadata to evolve independently of chat content.
